- short-term goal: Get a single query working
   - Simple Scotty server
   - Hook up to mongo
   - Retrieve the proper data
   - How does logging work? My own or can Scotty do some of this?
- next goal:
   - Document installing `aeson-bson` from dino- github in the wiki
   - API key checking
      - Store API key hashes in conf
   - Get resource-pool library involved for db connection pooling
- Need to use SSL to protect the API keys, this is a server-side thing with Apache or Nginx
   - Figure out virtual server with one of those
- LOOK INTO API VERSIONING FOR THE REST CALLS!!
- Our dates in the KS library data type don't convert to the same JSON as aeson-bson makes. Is this a problem? Probably, but what to do?
