- short-term goal: Get a single query working
   - Simple Scotty server
   - Hook up to mongo
   - Retrieve the proper data
   - How does logging work? My own or can Scotty do some of this?
- next goal:
   - API key checking
   - Get resource-pool library involved for db connection pooling

- Get some sort of authentication involved. Something we can use API keys with? Can wai-extra do this with its HTTP Basic?
- Need to use SSL to protect the API keys, this is a server-side thing with Apache or Nginx
